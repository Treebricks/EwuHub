    <string name="ewu_history">The idea of establishing a private university
        to provide quality education at an affordable cost in Bangladesh was
        first mooted by a group of prominent academics, business leaders, professionals
        and education enthusiasts led by Dr. Mohammed Farashuddin. With this end in view,
        this group formed a non-profit, non-political, charitable organization called Progoti
        Foundation for Education and Development (PFED). East West University is its first major
        project. Members of the Board of Directors of the University are: Mr. Jalaluddin Ahmed,
        Mr. S.M. Nousher Ali, Mr. Farooque B. Chaudhury, Dr. Rafiqul Huda Chaudhury,
        Mr. Syed Manzur Elahi, Dr. Mohammed Farashuddin, Mr. Mohammed Zahidul Haque R.Ph.,
        Dr. Saidur Rahman Lasker, Dr. Muhammad A. Mannan, Professor M. Mosleh-Uddin, Mr. Shelley
        A. Mubdi, Mr. M.A. Mumin, Dr. Khalil Rahman, Mr. H.N. Ashequr Rahman and Mrs. Razia
        Samad. After being accorded permission by the Government under the Private University
        Act (Act 34) of 1992, East West University was launched in 1996. Classes started in
        September 1996 with 6 faculty members and 20 students in the campus located at 43
        Mohakhali C/A, Dhaka-1212. Today there are over 281 faculty members and approximately
